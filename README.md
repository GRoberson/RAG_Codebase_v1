# RAG Codebase Assistant

ü§ñ An intelligent code analysis tool that uses Google Cloud's Vertex AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to help you understand and interact with your codebase.

## Overview

This project provides two main components:

1. **Python Script (`rag_codebase_local.py`)**: A standalone application for analyzing local code repositories
2. **Jupyter Notebook (`rag_codebase.ipynb`)**: An interactive notebook for analyzing GitHub repositories

Both components use Google Cloud's Vertex AI RAG Engine to create an AI assistant that can understand and answer questions about your code.

## Features

- üîç Analyze both local and remote (GitHub) code repositories
- üß† Use AI to understand and explain code functionality
- üí¨ Interactive Q&A about your codebase
- üìö Support for multiple programming languages and file types
- üåê Integration with Google Cloud's Vertex AI
- üîí Secure handling of code and data

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Cloud Project
- Google Cloud Storage bucket
- Appropriate Google Cloud credentials and permissions
- Required Python packages (installed automatically)

## Configuration

### Required Settings

```python
{
    'PROJECT_ID': "your-project-id",    # Your Google Cloud Project ID
    'BUCKET_NAME': "your-bucket-name",  # Your Google Cloud Storage bucket
    'CAMINHO_CODIGO': "./meu_codigo",   # Path to your code directory
}
```

### Optional Settings

- `LOCATION`: Google Cloud region (default: "us-central1")
- `PASTA_GCS`: Folder in GCS bucket (default: "codigo-para-analise")
- `TAMANHO_MAX_MB`: Maximum file size to process (default: 10MB)
- `MODELO_EMBEDDING`: Text embedding model (default: "publishers/google/models/text-embedding-005")
- `MODELO_IA`: AI model for responses (default: "gemini-2.5-flash")

## Supported File Types

The tool supports a wide range of file types, including:

- Programming Languages: `.py`, `.java`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.c`, `.cpp`, etc.
- Web Technologies: `.html`, `.css`, `.vue`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`
- Documentation: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`
- Configuration: `.yaml`, `.json`, `.toml`, `Dockerfile`
- And many more! (See full list in code)

## Usage

### Local Code Analysis (`rag_codebase_local.py`)

1. Configure your Google Cloud settings in the script
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python rag_codebase_local.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Upload your code to Google Cloud Storage
   - Create a RAG corpus from your code
   - Start an interactive Q&A session

### GitHub Repository Analysis (`rag_codebase.ipynb`)

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab
2. Configure your settings
3. Run each cell sequentially
4. Use the interactive Q&A section to analyze the code

## Security Notes

- üîê Your code is uploaded to your private Google Cloud Storage bucket
- üëÄ Access is controlled by your Google Cloud credentials
- üóëÔ∏è Option to clean up resources after analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful with sensitive code and credentials
